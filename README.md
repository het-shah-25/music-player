# üéµ Music Player Application

Welcome to the **Music Player Application**! This project is a full-stack application that provides a dynamic platform for managing and playing music. It features a sleek user interface built with React and a robust backend powered by Node.js and Express, with MongoDB handling data storage.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts:

- **`/frontend`**: The React.js application for the user interface.
- **`/backend`**: The Node.js and Express.js server for handling business logic and API requests.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/het-shah-25/music-player.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install frontend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Set up environment variables for the backend:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:

   ```dotenv
   DB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/music_player
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=465
   EMAIL_USERNAME=<your-email>
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=<your-email-password>
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<your-spotify-client-id>
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-spotify-client-secret>
   JAMENDO_CLIENT_ID=<your-jamendo-client-id>
   ```

2. **Set up any necessary frontend configuration (if applicable).**

### Running the Applications

1. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

   The backend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (default port).

2. **Start the frontend development server:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
